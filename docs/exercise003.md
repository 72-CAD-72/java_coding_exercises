# Exercise 003

This exercise is designed for you to explore Java arrays.

Pip the cat would like to set up an ice cream store with the following ice cream flavours encoded below.
This is useful because it helps Pip identify the ice cream flavours without opening the ice cream tubs as that would ruin the ice cream.

- Pistachio: 0
- Raspberry Ripple: 1
- Vanilla: 2
- Mint Chocolate Chip: 3
- Chocolate: 4
- Mango Sorbet: 5

Pip has already made some starter code in [Exercise003.java](../src/main/java/com/techreturners/exercise003/Exercise003.java).

Your job is to help Pip make the unit tests pass.
You'll see a number of unit tests in [Exercise003Test.java](../src/test/java/com/techreturners/exercise003/Exercise003Test.java)

Feel free to edit / add code however you prefer to solve the exercise.
